"I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence. 
I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else."

hypothetical question-
I will add another icon (like pencil icon) next to the delete icon, and by clicking this button
the user can edit the task description. It's intuitive to understand that the pencil button is 
used to edit the task
It's not hard to implement my solution. We need to add new button the to the row_todo_item layout,
and add new activity where the user can edit the text.
This soultion is consistent with the regular "edit" flows in the android world.
